# Causality

I like both strategy games where you take your time and think, and action games which test reflexes.

Causality features:
 - turn-based, team-based initiative
 - real-time movement
 - a reaction system where reactions can resolve before or after their triggers
 - and time dilation per unit, with each reaction tree layer dilating time more, slowing the action down to allow time to think and create complex reaction trees.

This is the first entry of my gameplay programmer portfolio.  More to come!
